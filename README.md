# BattyBirdNET-Data
Scripts and info on ML data set collection, refinement and use.

This projects targets to collect and publicly provide the best data for machine learning purposes for European bats. Thank you for being part of this data collection effort!
The BattyBirdNET-ML database is made available under the Open Database License: http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/. Any rights in individual contents of the database are licensed under the Database Contents License: http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/dbcl/1.0/. The scripts and code for processing the data are under the Apache 2.0 License.

To reach that aim try to:

- Use your best recordings for each species
- One species in a recording only
- 384kHz or higher recommended, 256kHz minimum
- Low noise levels (environment or recorder noise)
- Oganize your data in form of folders

    - battybirdnet-staging/YOUR_NAME/Latin name_Common name echo
    - battybirdnet-staging/YOUR_NAME/Latin name_Common name social
    - battybirdnet-staging/YOUR_NAME/Latin name_Common name buzz
      
- optional: Metadata in GUANO form embedded in the files

we separate echo location from calls that include social elements (see above convention) or feeding buzzes.
Upload is done via rclone. By adding your data you are ok with

- adding it under the Database Contents License to the BattyBirdNET-ML database under the Open Database License. 
- you made sure that you have the rights to do so, e.g. if you recorded the data yourself or the data is under a license that allows to add it.
- You made sure the calls are very likely made by the species you attribute it too.
- you checked to make sure (to a reasonable level of effort) that no humans were accidentally recorded. The easiest way to achieve this is to use a high-pass on the data only adding sounds over e.g. 10kHz.


Thank you and best regards.
